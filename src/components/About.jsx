      <h2 className='title'>Our Mission</h2>
        <p className='mainP'>The purpose and objective of 
            Theta Pi Sigma is to strengthen Greek life by 
            providing a vehicle for positive leadership, 
            change, and growth in the queer, trans*, questioning,
            pansexual, lesbian, intersex, gender-queer, gay,
            bisexual, asexual and ally communities. It is
            our intention to provide further opportunity to
            obtain a well-rounded educational experience
            by offering leadership skills and the exposure
            needed to succeed financially, academically,
            socially, and culturally.

          social Greek organization, this "Grorg" was founded
          on the principles of growth, progress, and
          leadership for the LGBTQIA+ community.
