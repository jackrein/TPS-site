          is to strengthen Greek life by providing a
          vehicle for positive leadership, change, and
          growth in the queer, trans*, questioning,
          pansexual, lesbian, intersex, gender-queer, gay,
          bisexual, asexual and ally communities. It is
          our intention to provide further opportunity to
          obtain a well-rounded educational experience
          by offering leadership skills and the exposure
          needed to succeed financially, academically,
          socially, and culturally.</p>
